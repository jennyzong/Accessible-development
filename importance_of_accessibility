### IMportance of Accessibility
```
  Accessibility in web development is crucial because it ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites effectively. By implementing accessibility features, such as text alternatives for images, keyboard navigation, clear and concise content, and proper use of color contrast, developers ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and use web content without barriers. This not only enhances user experience but also aligns with ethical and legal obligations to provide inclusive digital experiences for everyone.
